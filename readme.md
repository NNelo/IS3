Concepts for resolving Git conflicts
For using mergetool in git, we need to understand the following terminology to understand what is being merged:

LOCAL - the head for the file(s) from the current branch on the machine that you are using.
REMOTE - the head for files(s) from a remote location that you are trying to merge into your LOCAL branch.
BASE - the common ancestor(s) of LOCAL and BASE.
MERGED - the tag / HEAD object after the merge - this is saved as a new commit.
Common mergetool from editors will display both LOCAL and REMOTE so you can decide which changes to keep. Please read this tutorial explaining the HEAD objects if you do not know what it is. It will help your understanding of Git tremendously.
